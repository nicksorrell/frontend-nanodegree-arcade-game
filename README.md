#Pool Dash!

A simple HTML5 Froggerlike.

It's the middle of summer and the heat is up! Make your way to the pool for a cooling swim and some points on your score, but watch out for biting bugs. If you're lucky, you might even find some dropped change in the water for even more points! How high can you get your score?

##How to play

- The goal is to reach the pool at the top of the screen while avoiding the bugs
- Use the arrow keys to control the player
- Nabbing a gem will get you extra points

##About the project
I made this as part of my Front-End Development Nanodegree @ Udacity. The project boilerplate provided art assets and the game engine, but everything else was left to me to implement.
